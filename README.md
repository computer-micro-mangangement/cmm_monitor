# CMM - Monitor
This module is useful to everyone that easily wants to monitor your system remotely. This module will enable you to see network activity, cpu usage, ram usage, avialable disks and their free space and much more. This module is inspired by htop, top and bpytop. This project will probably be written in C++ and can be compiled (or downloaded) for each system from the same source code.

Here a quick sumnmary of all (future) modules:<br>
**_required:_** [CMM Server](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_server)<br>
CMM Hub (not avialable yet)<br>
[CMM Notifier](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_notifier) (in transition from indepentent to cmm-module) (this is a module wich will enable you to send notification to specific machines on your managed-network)<br>
[CMM Monitor](https://github.com/computer-micro-mangangement/cmm_monitor) (not avialable yet) (module to monitor your PC's performance (similar to the "Task Manager"(win), "top"(lin), "htop"(lin), etc.))<br>
